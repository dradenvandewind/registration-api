Testing Strategy
Unit Tests: Service layer logic

Integration Tests: API endpoints with test database

Mock External Services: Email service

Coverage: Minimum 80% coverage

Production Considerations
Security: HTTPS, rate limiting, input validation

Monitoring: Health checks, metrics, structured logging

Resilience: Retry logic for email service, dead letter queues

Scalability: Connection pooling, stateless design

CI/CD: GitHub Actions for automated testing
